== Hand-Made Crafts (http://www.handmadecrafts.tk)

This web app is built with Refinery CMS

Hosted on Heroku, monitored with New Relic, built with Refinery CMS with a Twitter Bootstrap hack, and the pictures are stored on my Amazon S3 using fog.

Since Heroku has a read-only filesystem, I use the 'fog' gem to upload the pictures to Amazon S3.

I use Heroku's method of setting config/environment variables so that none of my credentials are stored in this public source code.
